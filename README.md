# Minesweeper

Minesweeper is a classic logic-based puzzle game built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
The player uncovers tiles on a grid while avoiding hidden mines. Numbers on revealed tiles
indicate how many mines are adjacent, allowing the player to use deduction and pattern
recognition to safely clear the board.

## How It Works
- Left-click reveals a tile
- Right-click places or removes a flag
- Revealing a mine ends the game
- Clearing all non-mine tiles wins the game

## Features
- Random mine generation
- Recursive tile revealing
- Flagging system
- Win and loss detection
- Clean, minimal UI
- Fully runs in the browser (no libraries)

## What I Learned
- Grid-based game logic
- Handling mouse events in JavaScript
- Recursion for revealing empty tiles
- DOM manipulation
- Game state management

## How to Run
1. Download or clone the repository
2. Open `minesweeper.html` in any web browser
3. Play!

## Future Improvements
- Difficulty selection
